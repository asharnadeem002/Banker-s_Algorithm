When working with a banker's algorithm, it requests to know about three things:
● How much each process can request for each resource in the system.
● How much each process is currently holding each resource in a system. It
represents the number of each resource currently available in the system.

 Following are the important data structures terms applied in the banker's algorithm as

 The Banker's Algorithm is the combination of the safety algorithm and the resource request
